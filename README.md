- 👋 Hi, I’m @Magitman
- 👀 My interests are coding, going to the gym, playing videogames, playing and watching football and, last but not least, hanging out with friends
- 🌱 I can develop back-end applications with Java, SQL, Spring Boot and Spring Data; about front-end, I can work with both Angular and VueJS, although I'm more oriented towards the back-end side
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to a bright future
- 📫 How to reach me: you find out ;)
